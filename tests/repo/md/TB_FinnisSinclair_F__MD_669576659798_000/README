!*          A simple form of multi-ion interaction has been constructed for the purpose of
!*          atomistic simulation of transition metals. The model energy consists of a bonding
!*          term, which is the square-root of a site density rho_i, summed over atoms i, and a repulsive
!*          pairwise term of the form sum_ij 1/2 V(R_ij). The site density rho_i is defined as a
!*          sum over neighbouring sites j of a cohesive potential phi(R_ij). Both V and phi are
!*          assumed to be short-ranged and are parameterized to fit the lattice constant,
!*          cohesive energy and elastic moduli of the seven body-centred-cubic (b.c.c.) transition
!*          metals. The result is a simple model which, unlike a pair-potential model,
!*          can account for experimental vacancy-formation energies and does not require an
!*          externally applied pressure to balance the 'Cauchy pressure'.
