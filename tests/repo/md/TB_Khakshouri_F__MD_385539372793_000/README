!*          Irradiation of a metal by lasers or swift heavy ions causes the electrons to become excited. In the vicinity of
!*          the excitation, an electronic temperature is established within a thermalization time of 10–100 fs, as a result of
!*          electron-electron collisions. For short times, corresponding to less than 1 ps after excitation, the resulting
!*          electronic temperature may be orders of magnitude higher than the lattice temperature. During this short time,
!*          atoms in the metal experience modified interatomic forces as a result of the excited electrons. These forces can
!*          lead to ultrafast nonthermal phenomena such as melting, ablation, laser-induced phase transitions, and modified
!*          vibrational properties. We develop an electron-temperature-dependent empirical interatomic potential for tungsten
!*          that can be used to model such phenomena using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Finitetemperature
!*          density functional theory calculations at high electronic temperatures are used to parametrize the
!*          model potential.

!*          In this implementation an additional switch is added to prevent the free energy going to -infinity
!*          as the atoms are separated. Set use_DRM_temperatureswitch=.false. to return to the original paper version.
