This directory (ex_model_driver_P_LJ) contains a shifted Lennard-Jones
pair potential Model driver written in Fortran 90.

   phi(r) = 4 * epsilon * ( (sigma/r)^12 - (sigma/r)^6 ) + shift

where shift is computed so that phi(rcut) = 0.0

It complies with the KIM API interface standard, using any NBC and iterator or
locator mode, publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation of
`energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', `process_dEdr', and `process_dE2dr2'.
Its initializaton routine takes a KIM API object pointer and a pointer to a
string that contains the cutoff and Lennard-Jones parameters which define a KIM
Model based on this KIM Model Driver.

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, a parameter file is required.
This file must have the follwing format:
   Line 1: `cutoff' value in angstroms
   Line 2: Lennard-Jones `epsilon' value in eV
   Line 3: Lennard-Jones `sigma' value in Angstroms

The following files are in this directory:

Makefile
    makefile to compile and build executables with GNU or Intel compilers

    This file

ex_model_driver_P_LJ.F90
    Fortran 90 file that contains the implementation of the Lennard-Jones
    potential Model Driver

ex_model_driver_P_LJ.kim
    Template KIM descriptor file containing all variables and methods that are
    exposed by the driver through the KIM API interface.  This file will be
    used (by the make system) to generate a KIM descriptor file for each KIM
    Model based on this Model Driver.
