Openkim Pipeline
================

This contains the code for the [OpenKIM](https://openkim.org) pipeline
environment whose front-end can be viewed at the
[Pipeline](https://pipeline.openkim.org) subheading.

The goal of the pipline is to attempt to run all of the Tests in the OpenKIM
repository using all of the relevant Models.

Directory outline:

 * docs - sphinx documentation
 * logs - directory logs are written to
 * tests - test scripts (mostly out of date)
 * tools - a group of tools to help with development

For up-to-date documentation, please visit the official documentation page
[here](https://pipeline.openkim.org/docs).
