Rough Status
-------------

We have lots of old code lying around.  Things that should be refactored
 
  * kimobjects.TestResult  and cohort, VerificationResult and ErrorResult
  * template.py - most of it is all gone
  * kill kimobjects.ReferenceData, kimobjects.Properties, kimobjects.Primitives, kimobjects....
  * config is a bit of a mess, maybe go to actual configuration file, and a seperate logging.py to setup the loggers
  * make loggers go through messaging passing
  * what is database.py?
  * runner is dead

  
ToDo
----

 * make kimquery.py  that allows queries to the database
 * make kimobjects.Runner, kimobjects.Subject, kimobjects.ErrorResult, kimobjects.Result
  with kimobjects.??Result inhereting from kimobjects.Result
 * fix template.py, remove old things, clean, add query
 * make persistent YAML thing.  In fact, maybe generalize templating until the last second so we could switch back and forth 
 between YAML, JSON and whatever else people want.
